# "Unofficial" Chem 1A Calculators
## Luciano Loma Lorenzana
### Develop: 05/11/2022 - present

#### Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

## UPDATES:
01/11/2025 - moved the Makefile and PeriodicTable.txt file outside the /src directory, should make
compiling the calculators a bit more simple, less navigating through directories. Also added
the QuadraticFormula.cpp file into the Makefile, that way anyone can run that calculator using
the Makefile rather than typing a long command to compile.
