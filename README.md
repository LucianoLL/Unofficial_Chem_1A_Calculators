### Develop: 05/11/2022 - present

#### Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

## UPDATES:
08/29/2024 - I just created file for calculating anything assocaited with pH.
I haven't started coding anything, I just created the files, but it shoudln't take too
long to come up with working code and a client.
At the same time, I also updated the README file to a markdown file than just a 
simple text file, now there's headers.
