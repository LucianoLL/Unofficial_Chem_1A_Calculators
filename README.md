# "Unofficial" Chem 1A Calculators
## Luciano Loma Lorenzana
### Develop: 05/11/2022 - present

#### Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

## UPDATES:
01/11/2025 - I've done some file management, and updated the Makefile to account for the changes.
At the same time I changed the name of the /code directory to the /src directory. The same 
"make" commands should work as usual, no need for extra commands or anything like that. Also, 
currently working on a Docker file to simplify the process of installing and running the 
calculators.
