# "Unofficial" Chem 1A Calculators
## Luciano Loma Lorenzana
### Develop: 05/11/2022 - present

#### Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.


## UPDATES:
01/11/2025 - finally got around to creating a Dockerfile, along with a Python script to select
which executable/program to use. Still learning about Docker and implementing Python and C++
together, but hopefully, what I have is much more simple to run. Plus, with a Dockerfile
there is no need to manually install a Linux environment or remote access one. For those who
already know how to use and run Docker, it's up and ready. For those who don't, I'll write
some documentation on the Repo's Wiki on how to install Docker and run the files.
