Develop: 05/11/2022 - present

Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

UPDATES:
01/14/2023 - I just compiled the two of the programs (MolarMassClient and PeriodicTableClient)
and pushed the exectuables into the repository. They're both stored in the 'exectuable_files' 
folder, you can just download them directly from the GitHub repository, right from  the site.
