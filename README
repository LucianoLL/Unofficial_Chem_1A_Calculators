Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

UPDATES:
09/08/2022 - I finally got the MolarMassClient passing all of my own test cases, including the
edge cases. Mayber later today or tomorrow I'll start working on the moles to particles
program.
