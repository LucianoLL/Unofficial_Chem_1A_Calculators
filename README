Summary:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

UPDATES:
09/22/2022 - I just creditted Bailey Allott in the MolarMass.cpp file for helping out with the parenCase
function. With their suggestions, the MolarMassClient is now able to take any chemical compound
as an input.
